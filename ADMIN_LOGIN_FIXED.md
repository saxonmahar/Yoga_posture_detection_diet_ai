# ✅ ADMIN LOGIN - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong
An old backend server was running with outdated code that didn't return the `role` field.

## What I Did
1. Killed the old backend process (PID 18972)
2. Restarted the backend with updated code
3. Verified the `role` field is now returned

## Test It Now
1. Open browser: **http://localhost:3002/admin**
2. Login with:
   - Email: **sanjaymahar2058@gmail.com**
   - Password: **1234567890**
3. Click "Access Admin Panel"
4. You should see the Admin Dashboard!

## Servers Running
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3002
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:5001
- ✅ Admin Login: http://localhost:3002/admin

The admin login should now work perfectly! 🎉
